## Jon Petter (Screenshot 2 - Login-page)
Work steps:

1. Created the group in GitHub classrooms and ensured both members joined it.
2. Did some basic structure coding, printed the screenshots and drew the structural elements on them.
3. Had Andreas look over them.
4. Scanned and uploaded the pictures alongside some basic code.
5. Started on the demo work after setting up some structural shells on both the screenshot-pages to get an idea
   of what to do. Also did some work on the index page just to 
6. Did more demo work, primarily on the categories- & items-page.
7. After finalizing this and helping Andreas with GitHub (several pull requests for both),
   we started on our individual pages. Also helped him move CSS-code to the SCSS-file.
8. Gradually implemented the elements to the login-page, and ported some back to the demo
   after realizing both pages had to be there and having most elements ready for the login-page.
   Also added a link to the demo-page from the index-page.
9. Finished styling the login-page, uploaded to the branch. Improved/simplified some code in the "common.scss"-file.
